## Nightgames

Project Description:
NightGames is a public artwork and mobile app by the artist collective Meud that brings an audience together with the opportunity to collaboratively control an interactive environment using music, visuals and gesture. The players’ choices create the world they occupy through networking their smart phones with advanced technological systems including motion tracking, gesture recognition, interactive lighting, personal and quadraphonic sound. A rich terrain for free form exploration fills the exhibit space rewarding group cooperation, in addition to individual expression.

NightGames encourages players to make sound and enter into an imaginary world under their control. A playspace is defined by four speakers housed in towers at the edges, and a central sculpture illuminated by interactive lighting. In addition, a sculpture made of plexiglass pyramids will be deployed throughout the space, reacting to the players gesture. Beneath the entire sculpture, a steady rhythmic drum beat pulsates acting as a canvas onto which players can layer their sonic input. The speed of the beat and complexity of the canvas reflects the number of players and the relationship of their gestures to each other. The system rewards close collaboration with a richer melodic score and more reactive lighting. Through the sonification and visualization of proximity and social interaction, NightGames brings a conscious awareness to players that individuals impact and form a collective environment.

Innovative Nature of the project

This project seeks to further expand the public’s understanding of game play and theatre to include freeform interaction. These physical controllers represent part of a deeper research endeavor to innovate controllers for games that embrace all bodies and abilities. By crafting a playspace that rewards many kinds of interaction, these objects will have affordances for many possible ways of moving. As a person who has struggled on an off with partial disability, Phoenix Perry has passionately been pursuing alternative computational interactions for several years. This installation welcomes players who may have limited mobility or difficulty interacting with traditional forms of digital inputs.

NightGames will exist both as a public artwork and a personal sound/puzzle mobile application. In the public artwork, participants listen to tracks over headphones in an environment dominated by interactive pyramid sculptures. A simple bass line plays in the space, and participants hear their own interaction via their headphones. Like a silent disco, each person can exist in their own sonic and rhythmic space, but as they advance through the game by cooperating and syncing their motions with others, they will hear more lines of audio. The audience also will be able to control the pyramidal lighting sculptures, reinforcing the gameplay and encouraging group behavior.

Research has shown that people moving in synchrony brings people together and builds trust. This project seeks to further expand the public’s understanding of game play and theatre to include freeform interaction. By using smartphones as sensors we will develop embodied controllers for games that embrace all bodies and abilities. Our testing will focus on affect and we will explore the triggers for creating positive emotions with the body during play. By crafting a playspace that rewards many kinds of interaction, our controllers will have affordances for many possible ways of moving. This installation welcomes players who may have limited mobility or difficulty interacting with traditional forms of digital inputs.

Day 1
Today we got the secret theme, Evolution. After we brainstormed we came up with the initial idea of a matching game focusing on organizing forms. The player matches like forms into sets, which turn into new forms for matching. Each level is a series of forms that evolve into more a complex level.

We are currently inspired by the card game set and are starting off to create a game that combines these ideas with the concept a recursive system.Today we accomplished the design of the basic play mechanic and a simple design sketch.

Day2
The idea is evolving. And we now have a few possible play screens in place.

Coding in the sdk is falling into place. We now have working screens that transition from
Menu -> Start -> Game -> Ending

Day 3
We are open sourcing our game on github. My only request is that if you take from our code, give back in kind please. Shared code >

Do this tutorial! amazing tutorials >

It has everything you need for your framework and is easier to parse than some of the sdk, particularly for the physics engine. I got through the whole thing with a few cups of coffee at West Cafe in Williamsburg.

Day 4
Working physics and sprites! I spent all day thinking through the game logic only to have Anders come over and look over my shoulder and reduce our entire logic structure to one bitwise operation in python. Rule learned? KISS. More complex logic structures are completely not important. Get it working as simply as possible. Don’t be overwhelmed by being in a new sdk full of new features.

We did it!
Aftermath –
As some of you know Crystallon, was selected to move forward in the competition and we will be going to the GDC to compete against the top 4 NYC teams for a shot at backing from Playstation Mobile. We have 30 days (29 now) to create the next iteration of the game.

Here’s an interview we did for Playstation:
1) Some assets (screenshots, concept art, video, etc.) for me to add to the post?




2) A short description of what your game is and how it got from inception to “final” product?

In Crystallon, users create isometric cubes from faces with only two rules, all of the same elements for each of the 3 faces or all different elements for each face. The puzzle game confounds and challenges players to see all of the patterns in each level.

Concept to now
We were really spoiled by the theme. We went into the game jam already thinking about generative complexity. I’ve been making evolution and complexity games since I started making games in 2004 and Meg is a generative musician. One of the last games I created was with a Crystallographer, Marie Evelyn who introduced me to many of the core concepts of complexity in the context of game design. Her field of study is where the name of this game comes from.

“Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in solids. The word “crystallography” derives from the Greek words crystallon = cold drop / frozen drop, with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and grapho = write.” (Wikipedia)

Other than that, I am really inspired by the processing art community and in particular the art of Holgar Lippan. He has a series called Cubism 2.0 inspired by the Cubist architecture of Le Corbusier that was the visual inspiration for the project. For future levels, I’m particularly looking at the art style of Daniel Buren for inspiration.

From there, Ben came in with the idea exploring the rule set in Set and designed the basic rules for the game system. Really, without him we would not have developed such a clean game play experience. He was insistent we stick to only two basic rules for the whole game, all of the same or all different. Ben also brought in a level of attention to detail you’d only get from a consummate game designer. He’s an industry vet and proved to be adept at keeping the game within scope and scalable.

Meg designed the level flow and the experience as it moved from level as I developed the framework and Ben developed the game mechanic. Also, Meg immediately started coming up with outstanding sound design. Now, she’s contributing more innovative ways we can make the play interesting for the player. I know making the game sound truly generative is a goal of hers for the real game release.

It was an equal team effort that played elegantly to all of our strengths. As a group, we challenge each other and all bring in a significant amount of technical expertise. In many ways, I feel like we are a super group. I was able to hand pick my team mates and these are the amazing people I have chosen to be my partners for this insanity. I’m honored to work with them both.

3) What are your plans with the game now that the Jam is over? Do you still plan on publishing it on PSM? Do you have plans to publish anything else in the next year?

Sleep – we need it.

We are publishing a few games this year; Crystallon will hopefully be just one of them. Meg and I have been working together for years. Now, we are making a game called Emotional Growth that explores the impact emotions can have on evolution and ecology. Also, she and I have a band called #000000swan and are planning to release another “codex” this year. The entire record is based on the generative pattern found in the fibonacci sequence. Ben will indefinitely be involved in ever more amazing things as he continues to make games with Babycastles.

# Emotional Growth

Emotional Growth

Currently underway, Emotional Growth centers on emotional contagion and ecology. Using a series of smart, emotionally evocative bunnies, we are aiming to build an installation for the New York Hall of Science that allows children to see the impact of their emotions on an affective ecology. Using embedded IR sensors in each doll, we can know where users are within the space and map their location into a projected digital environment. As each child moves around the room with their chosen toy, they impact the system as a whole. A series of gestures will be trained into the system via machine learning to allow users to pick the colors, sound and patterns of their unique ecological imprints at the start of the game. Working with researchers and long term collaborators Margret Schedel (Associate Professor, Computer Music, Stony Brook) and Rebecca Fiebrink (Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Princeton) we are aiming to study the impact of this tangible computing system on emotion awareness.

The Quantified Self, Gallery Project Ann Arbor, MI Sept, 2012

The first version of Emotional Growth was a tablet app for Android and IOS that allows users to create an ecology based on different emotional choices which are reflected in the shape, health and lifespan of each organism created. The app is ongoing offering a collaborative creation visualizing the emotional choices of the participants.

Here’s a shot from the gallery and a few screen captures of selected emotional state drawings.

# Game Over

Game Over

Game Over was a thesis project done for my MS at NYU Poly advised by Katherine Isbister. This game abstracts play down to the fundamental procedural argument needed to create an embodied experience evoking negative affect. In Game Over, the user’s entire skeleton is mapped into the game, creating an in-game body double. The goal is to avoid being hit by falling objects. When each joint of the body is hit, it is deleted, slowly killing the player. A second player is given an iPad app that allows them to guide the position of the some of the falling objects. They can choose to hunt the first player or move the enemies away from their position. This game integrates the following frameworks in a complete technological rebuild: Flash Player 11, Flex 3.2, Starling, GPU acceleration, sprite sheets, the Box2D physics engine and AS3NUI.

For the last two years, I have been a member of the NYU Poly Game Innovation Lab where I have focused on self-directed and group projects. For my MS Thesis project, my line of inquiry was affect, and more specifically, how we can tap into the lived affordances of the body to hack into human emotions in a digital play space. To accomplish this goal, I created a series of two games, Nightmare Kitty and Game Over. The findings from multiple rounds of user testing drove my research and the evolution of the game. Utilizing 3rd wave HCI testing methodologies to connect to my audience, user testing became an integral part of the creative process. Techniques such as abstract drawing, open ended questions and self reporting were employed during the discovery phase. The results led to key insights uncovering the elusive properties to be considered when crafting emotionally charged embodied play. Chasing the white rabbit of emotional engagement, I utilized knowledge from a range of fields including: gaming, neurology, biochemistry, philosophy and psychology. The findings from user responses and research pointed the way to the thesis of the project. To create fear, the first emotion in the game, embodied systems should be supple experiences utilizing the affordances of the body within the physical world when that body extrapolates into game space.


I am unable to summarize my entire process here but there are a few findings that are worth sharing in summary

    Design interfaces appropriate to the body that take into account the affordances of the body in the physical world. Do not attempt to map an older user interfaces like arrow keys on to a body.
    Experience is a lived, evolving relationship unique to each person and situation. This terrain holds the keys to making a successful embodied design.
    Abstraction and AR seem to work well but characters require cognitive overload that might need additional levels of user customization to feel appropriate to their individual lived awareness.

Some images from my user testing process are included at the end of each post. The open ended shapes were by far the most interesting to me as a designer.

Video talk of my findings at Girl Gamer 12/2012

# Nightmare Kitty

The two game process to uncovering embodied design.

Two games were generated during the creation of my MS thesis for NYU Poly, Nightmare Kitty (NK) and Game Over (GO). Both share the objective of creating an emotional experience. It is worthwhile to note that both games use the same basic enemy mechanic of being hunted by randomly falling objects and that their aim to create the emotion of fear in the player. After these commonalities, the games are radically different.

During NK, the player guides a balloon mouse head attached to their head via skeleton tracking in the game away from randomly dropping cats in an endlessly side scrolling environment. Players can be hit five times before exploding. To rid themselves of a kitty, they can land on it and pop it from above. This move is advantageous as the cats bounce themselves off screen and can also pop the balloon from underneath as well as above. Similarly to old school arcade cabinet games, survival is the objective of the game. The game was first presented at Maker Faire NYC 2011 and won two Editor’s Choice Blue Ribbon awards. (Make)

After the initial success of the project, further informal study on the usability of the game was conducted via additional play tests and exhibitions, the most notable of which was at the Art and Code 3D 2011 conference at Carnegie Mellon. After these play tests and exhibitions, doubts existed about the game’s ability to evoke emotion as well as the usability of the experience. Users had fun playing the game but often clamed there were tracking problems. See the later section titled Results for Nightmare Kitty (NK) User Testing for complete details. These suspicions sparked a round of research and development plus formal user testing done with the instruments found in Appendix A. Results revealed opportunities for improvement in the interaction, design and play. From this point, the game evolved enough to warrant the creation of a new game, Game Over.

# Yamove

Yamove

Yamove! is a b-boy style dance battle game that uses tech to augment face-to-face dancing. Players compete in pairs, aiming for high intensity, in-synch, diverse dance routines. Each player wears an iOS device strapped to his/her forearm, and teams compete in 3 rounds. The game is hosted by an MC and results are displayed on a big screen. Scoring is based on accelerometer data from the devices. The experience is more social and spectacular than the current console-based dance games, because players face off and the crowd forms more naturally around them and the MC. The game was inspired by research that shows how being physically ‘in synch’ brings people together emotionally and builds trust.

Yamove! was a featured game at the NYU No Quarter exhibition in 2012, and was also played at the 2012 World Science Festival. The research behind Yamove! will be presented in a keynote at MobileHCI in September 2012.

As a seasoned designer, my ability to create appropriate art direction for a game project was an obvious endeavor.Consecutive rounds of testing were insightful and plans are in the works to create additional skins and user content. The most valuable experience I gained was an understanding of how accelerometer data can be categorized from iOS devices through multiple vectors to rank and score players and the importance of developing meaningful vectors that match user expectations.

# Picky Sticky Pollen




Description:
Picky Sticky Pollen is an adaptation of Phoenix Perry’s Honey, an interactive video game exploring issues of survival and the environment. Honey demonstrates even the smallest creatures’ vital importance to their ecosystem as they struggle to survive in a unique fantasy-world.


Be part of a hive! Competing hives direct crazed worker bees as they scurry to pick up pollen in this colorful lawn game.
Debuted, Come Out and Play 2009. Designers: Phoenix Perry and Marie Evelyn for Analogous Projects


Download the rules and card pack here and play! >
Game Overview

This reality-based adaptation of Phoenix Perry’s interactive video game consists of costumed worker bees (Amy Benson, Ben Margolis, Douglas Repetto, Jenny Torino, and Melissa Gawlowski) within a colorful, pollen-filled lawn. Teams take turns shouting commands in an attempt to manipulate the bees’ final PollenCount. Part spectator-sport, part New York Stock Exchange at closing time, this fast-paced theatrical game introduces a new set of bee-personalities at every round. Which characters will you get?

The Rules
Summary:

    Players divide into teams of four. Each team chooses one player to serve as the Queen Bee.
    The lawn contains an assortment of pollen: RedPollen, YellowPollen, WhitePollen, and PurplePollen.
    A group of worker bees scurry around the pollen-filled lawn according to one of three types of rules: “Pick up all”; “Scatter all”; or “Trade (thiscolor) for (thatcolor)”.
    Each team collectively decides a set of commands for the worker bees to follow.
    The rules are shouted by the Queen Bee, and are carried out by the worker bees for twenty-second intervals.
    Each team has a total of five turns.
    The team whose PollenGoal most closely matches the worker bees’ final PollenCount (i.e., the amount of gathered RedPollen, YellowPollen, WhitePollen, and PurplePollen) wins!

Rounds:
This game is fast-moving and will allow for several rounds of play.

Bio: Analogous Projects

Complexity theory is not new to art or to our culture. It migrated from computer science and biology to economics and art and, with the advent of the world wide web, it invaded our collective subconscious. Analogous seeks to support complexity-driven art and artists playing under this conceptual umbrella of “Interaction Art”. Progress occurs by metaphor and analogy: Their hope is (by bringing together people and projects irrespective of media and genre) to enable philosophical crosstalk.

Analogous events and performances have been reviewed in The Wire, Make Magazine, Time Out New York, and The Village Voice. They received a Village Voice Best-of-NYC Award in October 2008 for “Best Arts Organization Centered Around Recycling”. For more information about Analogous and current Analogous projects, visit AnalogousProjects.org.

Honey was originally produced as part of a HarvestWorks 2006 Residency.

# 000000swan Research
000000Swan is 1/2 research project, 1/2 band. Several papers and applications have been born during our exploration of what is possible between gaming, music and gesture. What follows is a catalog of this research. Included are Unity applications you can explore and deconstruct, talks at DorkBot and processing created gesture controlled video samples. Watch the videos if you want to understand the technology behind what we are working on.

These images are all from 2010 – they were created specifically for a show at Babycastles. For this show we created a gesture controlled musical playspace. Much to our sadness, when we arrived there was a glass window directly behind us and our cameras simply would not track. This, as a result never saw the light of day, except in documentation on youtube.

# Design

## Olay Grammy’s

Client: Olay
Role: Art Director & User Experience Design
Agency: Organic

Assignment: Concept and design all assets for Olay.com and facebook for the Grammy’s partnership with an emphasis on the Regenertist brand. For this project, we produced two conceptual directions for the creative work. Each idea focused on a different aspect of the Grammy’s and the exclusive content Olay was creating around the event. One concept focused on the idea of a behind the scenes back stage pass. The winning concept focused on the idea of VIP access to the exclusive event with secret tips from celebrities.

## Nike

Client: Nike Role: Art Director. Agency: R/GA

Assignment: Design two looks for the online Nike game Attitude for You. Extend this look to include the product design, in-store experience and retail tags.

This campaign was an interactive social game and store experience for Nike for teen girls. The aim was to re-invigorate the “Just Do It” mantra by allowing user generated content. The site asked users to upload their own slogans onto a tee-shirt. Girls could also rate other submitted quotes. The most popular shirts were produced by Nike at the end of the game and sold nationwide. By extending this idea to include store windows, garment tags and in-store displays, I turned the entire shopping experience into an interactive competition sparking conversation and a sense of brand personalization. The interactive store windows pulled popular mantras from the website and allowed people from the street to vote as well as online users. The shirt tags included crack and peal stickers that allowed girls to play with the concept outside of the digital experience of the product.

## Dubspot

Client: Dubspot
Role: Creative Director

Assignment: Develop two conceptual directions and brand narratives for the Dubspot identity. Do a competitive analysis and expand the band to exist in a wider market online outside of New York City. Dubspot is a DJ and music production school in Manhattan.

Inspired by bold colors and club culture, the bars in the logo invoke sound clips from audio production tools. Look One resonates culturally outside of the dub community, which has been their major market up until this point, reaching a wider audience.
Look Two: Music Making for the Masses
Inspired by Swiss minimalism while invoking a digital dial, this look creates a friendly and approachable interface for music production within the logo itself. With a heavy emphasis on social tools, Dubspot becomes a central hub for students and professionals to share tips and stay on top of the rapidly changing field of audio production. This approach seeks to convey the new found simplicity in digital music creation.

Client: M&Ms
Role: Art Director
Agency: Grey Interactive
Assignment: Concept and design for an online game for M&M and Indiana Jones. From coming up with the game to designing characters, this project was one of the most fun assignments I’ve ever been part of to date. The team rapidly iterated game play and ideas and the entire project came in two weeks ahead of deadline. We crafted a rich gameplay experience including a maze, challenges to unlock doors, clues and a leader board. The project represents the most heavily designed work in my portfolio. We were given very few assets and most of the elements are drawn in Illustrator and then shaded in Photoshop. The stone M&Ms represent some of the best photoshop work in this portfolio.


## J&J, One Touch Diabetic Brand

Client: J&J, One Touch Diabetic Brand
Role: Associate Creative Director
Agency: Rapp Collins
Assignment: Lead the social presence for a diabetes monitor. Spark conversations in the community in inviting and meaningful terms.
The work shown here highlights several interesting projects. Working from the “Life First” brand campaign platform given to us by an outside creative agency, we crafted several facebook campaigns.
Testing Streak

Testing Streak is a social and mobile app allowing diabetics to log their glucose levels throughout the day. By regularly testing, they learn to manage their condition. Integrating game dynamics into the app, they use gaming techniques to modify behavior.
By data visualizing their numbers over time in connection to behavior, we can reveal their pattern.
Each streak is only a week long and the entire game community can connect and encourage each other along the way. Challenges between players provide knowledge while fostering community. Each week unlocks a new badge giving players status along with rewards.

The You First Visualizer is a facebook sapplet that mines the user’s status updates and visualizes the top 50 words they post most frequently on top of their profile picture. This sapplet aims to show users they are more than just their condition and underscores the empowering and mobile nature of the product.
The D All-Star of the week is an ongoing weekly award given within the community. Selected from users sharing stories about how they put life ahead of diabetes, the competition inspires the community as a whole.

## The Horror
The Horror generative drawing series draws from vintage horror films with an augmented reality component. By using shapes found in cinematic images as a generator, these drawings draw parallels between human cultural forms and biological algorithms. Using augmented reality, this series also plays with AR as location for a new form of horror. Photos from… more »

## More drawings

My process involves ink drawings I often scan and recompose digitally. Having a separate section for drawings nearly feels a bit forced given how many other projects I have with illustration in them up on the site, but this section serves a home for the orphans of whimsy that never really belonged to a game…

## Human Networks
Around 2011, I started thinking of different ways my gallery could run and I drew the possible structures as graphs. These configurations represent possible social relationships where each line is a connection and each main dot one of the gallery founders or main members. Network 1 is a very centralized structure where we would reach… more »

## Crakced LCD

I’m fairly obsessed with broken technology. This interest came in 2000 when my body was completely destroyed by anti-body interface design aka the computer keyboard and mouse. Since then I have been photographing and saving glitches of all sorts as a representation of the fissure between us and technology. These are a few of my favorites. A recent photo from this image archive was the cover for Electronic Music (Cambridge Introductions to Music). I’ll post them as I find them scattered around drives.


## The Song of Despair

The Song of Despair interactive music box.


While this project remains filed in the uncompleted folder, I’m developing an interactive music box for Margaret Schedel of 000000Swan as part of her installation “20 Love Songs and the Song of Despair.” Each of the 20 music boxes contains an iPod that plays sound and video. This box, titled The Song of Despair, will trigger all other boxes when it is opened.

This box is cut in black acrylic plastic. The design echoes vintage sea maps. These maps often had to depict areas of unknown terrain. The more fantastical cartographers often drew dragons and other imaginary beings living in uncharted parts of the sea.

## 000000swan


000000swan Research

000000Swan is 1/2 research project, 1/2 band. Several papers and applications have been born during our exploration of what is possible between gaming, music and gesture. What follows is a catalog of this research. Included are Unity applications you can explore and deconstruct, talks at DorkBot and processing created gesture controlled video samples. Watch the videos if you want to understand the technology behind what we are working on.

These images are all from 2010 – they were created specifically for a show at Babycastles. For this show we created a gesture controlled musical playspace. Much to our sadness, when we arrived there was a glass window directly behind us and our cameras simply would not track. This, as a result never saw the light of day, except in documentation on youtube.





Serious Dorkbot talk:

dorkbot-nyc, 03 November 2010 — Phoenix Perry , Margaret Schedel and Rebecca Fiebrink : 000000swan: HEXCODE from dorkbot on Vimeo.

Silly video demo with our camera input

Then the kinect came out. Glass windows will not stop us! We went ahead and brought that into place and this unity game / app was made:



Watch me demo it.

Note you will need to run an osc signal into the app on the setup channels to make anything happen. Check out the OSC scripts for details in the inspector.

We then got very serious indeed and wrote an academic paper.

## Memory Systems

The electronic music duo Memory Systems’ album Ad Placement for the Collective Unconscious is based around the idea of a ficticious corporation that provides “Accu-Memory revivification.” These enhanced memories come at the price of enduring commericals placed directly into the client’s psyche. We approached the packaging for the CD as if were designing for a high-tech multinational coorporation. The feel is equal parts Exxon, Prada, and 2001: A Space Odyssey

Brian Jackson (synths, laptops, bass, vibes) and Phoenix Perry (vocals, sounds, visuals) may be based in New York’s criminally-hip Williamsburg neighbourhood but electroclash wannabees they most certainly aren’t. Their electronic soundsc(r)apes have an edge and individuality lacking in so many others. The big thing that marks Memory Systems out from the legion of electro-inclined artists out there is that they have stories to tell, stories about aliens, about the future of society, about reality. Not for them some Euro chick muttering sweet nothings about cocaine, champagne and limousines. They’re serious about their music and sonically their influences run the gamut from the obvious (Kraftwerk, Soft Cell) to the more obscure (Console, Global Communications), going deep and dark and soft and sweet, sometimes all at the same time. [Although the duo are not without humour too - 'Spirits In The Material World' is a loose and funkified take on The Police standard.) The album that will bury the electroclash 'phenomenon' completely for once and for all? Let's hope so.
Kieran Wyatt - FACT (NME, URB)- Jan 2003

Memory Systems take their synthetic vision seriously, clearly straying from the straightforward rhythmic structures associated with synth-driven dance music. Although danceable in its own right, this departure results in deft programming strides [and] features female vocals significantly more subdued than the likes of compatriots Ladytron and Adult. [An] appealing release for those interested in synthtronica without an overarching pop or new-wave feel.
XLR8R Magazine – June 2002

Interview from the SF Weekly in May 2002.

Back in the ’80s, the future promised relief from recession, Star Wars (the movie and the missile defense), synth pop, break dancing, Madonna, and a Bush in the White House. Now that the present is that future, we find that everything that wasn’t supposed to still be here is, only it’s all slightly different. Like watching the enhanced anniversary edition of E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, our recollection of the past seems to have been subtly altered. As San Francisco experimental synth pop outfit Memory Systems puts it, “Memory isn’t what it used to be.”

This slogan is at the root of what Phoenix Perry — Memory Systems’ singer, visual artist, and co-producer — calls “post-futurism,” defined as “not the study of the future, but what the future should have been.” She came up with the idea while curating an art exhibit in 2000 called “Air Portugal II” at S.F.’s Pond Gallery, in which she saw a unifying theme to the various works. Most of the art juxtaposed old and new technology, such as projecting the television news through a microscope and using a plant’s electrical impulses to determine the sequence of video images displayed on a computer.

Around the time of “Air Portugal II,” Perry went to a show by early electronic musician Morton Subotnick and met Brian Jackson, Memory Systems’ future co-producer and synthesizer specialist. Recognizing a shared taste for ’80s keyboard bands and a fascination with the way the future seemed to be stagnating, the pair came up with a flurry of projects for bringing people together around these concepts. Unfortunately, after planning to institute a community Web site at www.form8.com, both artists developed repetitive stress disorder from computer jobs and couldn’t devote the number of typing hours required. (A friend currently updates the site, which serves as an info source for the club night “Synth.”) The couple then decided to focus their energies on one of the quintessential artifacts of the post-futurist present: the synthesizer. Considered hypermodern in the ’50s yet still capable of suggesting a sci-fi aesthetic today, the instrument became the theme of “Synth,” Perry and Jackson’s floating electro/new wave/abstract techno party, and the centerpiece of Memory Systems, both of which began around February 2001.

Although Perry and Jackson clearly revel in the trendy ’80s renaissance — booking campy Euro-disco tribute act Hong Kong Counterfeit and Finnish robot funksters Mr. Velcro Fastener among others for “Synth” — they maintain a critical distance from the genre, in an effort to play with its tropes. They formulated a business model, for instance, to capitalize on this brave but not so new world, with its atrophied confidence in a different tomorrow. “The idea is that we don’t live in our future, we live in The Future,” Perry explains from the pair’s shared Haight-Ashbury apartment, “the future that’s white and sterile and where everything’s backed up on database. Everybody’s thoughts and memories and ideas are able to be traded and stored — now you can buy certain experiences and dreams. So the idea for Memory Systems is that we’re selling these memories, and they can be tailored to your desires.”

“Don’t let repressed memories stop you from enjoying your present,” Jackson adds in mock voice-over. “For example, we can change your memories of getting bullied so you can remember being the man your dad told you to be.”

Memory Systems offers such products in the following formats: audio (its nostalgic renditions of the Top 40 keyboard sound of the Reagan years), visual (corresponding video clips from some vaguely futuristic cityscape), and conceptual (faux advertising mottoes interspersed in the videos). During live performances, the group weaves together music, video art by Perry and her collaborator Jenny Young, and projected messages like “Changing the face of identity since 2001,” “Making Scientology obsolete,” and “Memory Systems — it takes the fear out of living.” At first blush, the presentation appears to be very much in line with the retro ’80s kitsch — Perry and Young wear long red gloves and fitted, military-style black dresses, and Jackson wields a goofy Buck Rogers- looking bass — but the sloganeering and existential film narratives suggest that the irony runs deeper.

“We’re definitively trying to make you uncomfortable with some of the ideas we present,” Perry says. “Like with the new video we’re filming, Brian’s carrying a briefcase that has some unstated value in this futuristic society, and he’s being chased endlessly, but you’re not sure why. There’s no real direction or point to the story; it’s as if the information that you’re supposed to be getting has become empty. Then at the end, the case finally comes open, and it’s full of blank paper. All he can do in the movie is run, but he doesn’t know even why he’s doing it.”

In another video, two women attempt to embrace but are thwarted by their motorcycle helmets. Like the chase scene and the term “post-futurism” itself, there’s a certain absurdity built into the clip’s imagery, as well as a quasi-political subtext. “All these forces have been set into motion over the decades, and everyone’s doing these things because that’s what we do in the postindustrial world,” Jackson explains. “Go to your job, go home, do things to numb yourself so you can go back to your job. I’m sure there are probably some people who get fulfillment from that, but I don’t think most people do.”

Unlike the armchair social critics of postmodernism, who are long on observations but short on solutions, Perry and Jackson intend to effect change through their art. In fact, much of the Memory Systems package comes off like a sendup of the staid, noncommittal electronic music formula. The group’s explicitly stated agenda, its attention-catching look, and its ambitious multimedia show all seem like the antithesis of a DJ in a sweat shirt hunched over the decks in the back of a club. Not surprisingly, Perry and Jackson don’t have much connection to the mainstream dance scene. Neither went through a clubbing phase, and the main reason they started “Synth” was to offer a respite from the straight-lipped, four-on-the-floor world of house music. Even Jackson’s use of a bass in performance is mostly theatrical — it actually just triggers a synthesizer — since the prop is meant to evoke the kind of live performance entity that the isolated, machine-fiddling producer was supposed to replace.

But a cynic might argue here that the type of electronic music Memory Systems purveys is closer to the contemporary ideal of form over content than a statement against it. Indeed, the group’s songs are either entirely instrumental or include what Perry calls “intentionally Bubblegum” lyrics. The pair did have one tune that overtly explored some of their ideas, but they decided to ax it because it sounded like a Dead Kennedys homage.

“We settled on a less heavy-handed route with the music,” Jackson says. “We decided that it would be too limiting to present a message that strongly. So the music is there to be enjoyed on its own, but for people who notice that there’s something else going on, they can research into some of the ideas we’re putting out there. It’s more the approach of offering a piece of candy that’s been attached to a string that we can then reel them in with.”

On Memory Systems’ six-song debut, Making Your Mind a Better Place to Be, recently released on the group’s own Form Records, the bait is sugar-rush-gratifying indeed. Jackson counterbalances the emotive synthesizer tones and forlorn keyboard moan of the Cocteau Twins, Soft Cell, and Laurie Anderson with hiccuping drum machines that burp along to the infectious grooves of contemporary electro. For her part, Perry intertwines her voice with the mesh of keyboard lines, dissolving her unintelligible words into wisps of atmospheric melody.

“We’re really into sweet, poppy, fun music,” she says. “We don’t want to overload anyone with critical theory or become another Negativland.”

So maybe Memory Systems proves that video did kill the radio star. Perhaps content can no longer stand alone in our sound-byte-saturated age. Memory Systems has strategically situated itself at the nexus of high concept and quick fix, from which it’s able to dabble in innocuous pop tunes and visual agitprop at the same time — the old one-two punch perfected by groups like the Velvet Underground.

“Meaning can come in many forms, not just verbal and not just through lyrics,” Jackson observes. “In the way that good abstract art can still say something to you, how it can affect you metaphysically — that’s what we want to achieve with Memory Systems. Even if someone walks away with just a feeling of something deeper, we’ve succeeded

Phoenix Perry creates physical games and user experiences. A consummate advocate for women in game development, she founded Code Liberation Foundation. This organization teaches women to program games for free. Since starting in 2012, this project has reached over 1000 women in the New York area between the ages of 16 to 60. Fostering professional growth and mentoring new leaders in the field, she strives to infuse the industry with new voices. As principle founder in Dozen Eyes, a game company specializing in physical installations and inspiring social change, she also is an entrepreneur. This fall, she joins HKU in The Netherlands as a Senior Lecturer in interaction design and games. She is a researcher at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering focused on empowerment and diversity in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).

Her speaking engagements include GDC, Games for Change, The Open Hardware Summit, Indiecade, Comic Con, Internet Week, Create Tech, IBM Dev Pulse, Montreal International Games Summit and NYU Game Center among others. Perry’s creative work spans a large range of disciplines including drawing, generative art, video, games, interfaces and sound. Her projects have been seen worldwide at venues and festivals including the GDC, E3, Come out and Play, Maker Faire at the New York Hall of Science, Lincoln Center, Transmediale, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, LAMCA, Harvest Works, Babycastles, European Media Arts Festival, GenArt, Seoul Film Festival and Harvestworks. In 2011 she co-authored the book, Meet the Kinect with Sean Kean and Johnathan Hall. Finally, she has curated since 1996 in a range of cultural venues, the most recent of which is her own gallery, Devotion Gallery until 2014. Devotion was a Williamsburg gallery focused on the intersection of art, science, new media, and design.


## About

The most defining traits about us are the ones that carry through from childhood and become reocurring themes in adulthood. For me, the connecting thread of my life has been a love for play and interactivity. Technology’s constant companionship provides the canvas on which I form my understanding myself and the world. Professionally, I pursue many different lenses of this exact same obsession. From art projects to design to serious research involving affect and digital experiences, I’m only ever racing one beam.
