eHello, I'm Phoenix. I am an artist and activist who often uses culture as a medium. I've got an odd compulsion to bring systems thinking into communities. I'm interested in how organizational structures can impact social change. Often I experiment with different forms of social engagement through conceptual ideas, such as graph theory, emergent systems, and mesh networks. I like to think of building organizational structures like writing social fictions.

Devotion Gallery was a gallery in Williamsburg Brooklyn from 2009 - 2014 that was at the intersection of art, science, media, and design. We presented cross-disciplinary work drawing from architecture, computation, gaming, biology, fabrication, interface design, open-source communities, cloud computing, sound, and complexity. We held over 200 events and exhibitions during our run and supported artists pioneering in electronics, gaming, machine learning, algorithmic design, AR, and VR.

Code Liberation
Code Liberation catalyzes the creation of digital games and creative technologies by women, nonbinary, femme, and girl-identifying people to diversify STEAM fields. I have mentored, worked with and have had the privilege of calling my friends a pioneering new wave of women in video games who have won some of its highest honors including:
•	Nina Freeman (Fullbright – Game Development, GDC Nuovo Award)
•	Caroline Sinders (Wikimedia – Online Harassment Researcher and public figure)
•	Catt Small (Etsy – Senior Product Designer, Founder of Game Devs of Color)
•	Jane Friedhoff (Google Creative Labs – Game Developer with titles released on Nintendo).
•	Adelle Lin (Intel – Machine Learning Developer)

We have partnered with groups such as the BFI, V&A, NYU, Goldsmiths, the UN, The Girls Scouts, MOMA, PAX, Games for Change, and Black Girls Code to create educational content focused on games development which we have delivered mostly for free to the public reaching over 3000 women in the last 5 years.

Most recently, I wrote an MA in Independent Games and Playable Experience Design at Goldsmiths.
Focusing on developing aesthetic awareness, students create compelling mechanics and the ability to craft innovative narratives in games and immersive experiences

# Speaking Appearances
I speak as an advocate for inclusion in STEAM and Video Games. Also, I do talks about my own work and do tech breakdowns on interesting topics. My speaking Appearances include Resonate, A Maze, Indiecade, GDC and more. <a href "talks.html"> Watch a few here. </a>  

That said, if you can't beat them, join them. In 2015, along with Caroline Sinder and other women from Code Liberation, I helped to found Facets, an interdisciplinary creative coding, interactive art, and videogames un-conference.FACETS is a conversational based creative un-conference with a focus on underrepresented voices and demographics in STEM and art.

Fucking hell mate. Do you ever sleep?
Not really, no. I wake up at 3.30 AM and read dystopian Sci-fi until 5am. Maybe that's my problem.


I also ran a little game studio, Dozen Eyes, I did with Ben Johnson for a few years.

Also, I make video games and immersive experiences that look at social structures and propose radical forms of interactions via play. My game interventions have been shown world wide at events like GDC, Indiecade, E3, A Maze, Playful Arts, and Now Play This.
