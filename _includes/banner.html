      <p>I am an artist and activist who often uses culture as a medium. I've got an odd compulsion to bring systems thinking into communities. I'm interested in how organizational structures can impact social change. Often I experiment with different forms of social engagement through conceptual ideas, such as graph theory, emergent systems, and mesh networks. I like to think of building organizational structures like writing social fictions.</p>
